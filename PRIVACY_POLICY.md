# Privacy Policy (Kora Tuning Companion)

Effective date: 2026-02-14

Kora Tuning Companion ("the app") is designed to work offline. This policy explains what data the app uses and how it is handled.

## Summary

- The app does **not** collect or sell personal data.
- Microphone access is used for the tuner and is processed **on-device**.
- Tuning presets and settings are stored **locally** on your device.
- The app does not require an internet connection and does not include third-party analytics/ads SDKs.

## Data the app uses

### Microphone audio (tuner)

If you enable the tuner, the app requests microphone permission (`RECORD_AUDIO`) so it can detect pitch.

- Audio is processed in real time on your device to calculate pitch/cents.
- The app does not record, store, or upload microphone audio.

### Local app data (presets/settings)

The app stores your selected instrument configuration, intonation offsets, and any user presets on your device so they persist between sessions.

- This data remains local to your device unless you back up/restore your phone.

## Sharing of data

The app does not share your data with third parties.

## Children’s privacy

The app is not designed to collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy

If the app’s data practices change, this policy will be updated.
